_**Charybdis**_ is a quiz system embedded in C, exploring various problem solving methods for users to train their brains and decipher the answers for the prompted problems.

# _| Q/As |_
## (i) — _<ins>**W<sub>hy is this called</sub> CHARYBDIS?**</ins>_
+ _**Charybdis**_ is known as one of Greek's mythological sea monsters, specifically known to create whirlpools by consuming and releasing large seabeds located in between _Sicily_ and _Italy_, the _Strait of Messina_. They're also presented as one of _Odysseus_'s challenges (alongside _Scylla_) at sea during his odyssey. To present a monster as a challenging foe, you'd have to make it challenging for the user. In return, you'll also face these challenges yourself.
+ It is a challenging project for me, the creator, since it involves heavy-induced programming extrapolation and complexity. I'm dealing with embedded systems and micrcontrollers, initializing general ports and connecting peripherals to the desired components (such as the LCD, seven-segment, and buttons), code documentation will be technical-heavy yet for general clarification should be satisfactory for readers to review.
## (ii) — _<ins>**W<sub>hat is the progress here</sub>?**</ins>_
+ Right now, you can review the update reports ``UPDATES.md``, where I'll highlight the progress of the system so far.
