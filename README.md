+ Charybdis is known as one of Greek's mythological sea monsters, specifically known to create whirlpools by consuming and releasing large seabeds located in between Sicily and Italy, the Strait of Messina. They're also presented as one of Odysseus's challenges (aside Scylla) at sea during his odyssey. To present a monster as a challenging foe, you'd have to make it challenging for the user.
+ It's also a challenging project for me, the creator, since it involves heavy-induced programming extrapolation and complexity. I'm dealing with embedded systems and micrcontrollers, initializing general ports and connecting peripherals to the desired components (such as the LCD, seven-segment, and buttons), code documentation will be technical-heavy yet for general clarification should be satisfactory for readers to review.
